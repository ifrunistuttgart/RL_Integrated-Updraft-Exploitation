## Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Integrated Updraft Mapping and Exploitation <img src="/resources/logo.png" align="right" width=100/> <br/> 
This repository includes a reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end type integrated thermal updraft localization
and exploitation.

### Overview
Autonomous soaring constitutes an appealing academic sample problem for investigating machine learning methods within
the scope of aerospace guidance, navigation, and control. The stochastic nature of small-scale meteorological phenomena
renders the task of localizing and exploiting thermal updrafts suited for applying a reinforcement learning approach. 

This repository includes a reinforcement learning framework for solving the problem of integrated thermal updraft
localizations and exploitation. The framework was developed by researchers at the
 [Institute of Flight Mechanics and Controls (iFR)](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart.

More detailed information about the learning approach, the implementation, and the flight
test results can be found in the associated paper listed below.

### Getting started
This repository contains the full source code, which was used to train the agent. 
The *glider* training environment is an extension of the [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) library. 
It implements a novel three-degrees-of-freedom (3 DoF) model of the aircraft dynamics in the presence of an arbitrary,
dynamic wind field.
 
#### Prerequisites
To run the training environment, you need to install a virtual Python 3.8 environment with the following packages:
gym (0.17.1), 
pytorch (1.4),
numpy (1.12.3),
scipy (1.6.2),
pandas (1.1.3) and
matplotlib (3.4.3).

To register the gilder module in your virtual environment, run the following command inside this project folder: 
```
pip install -e glider
```
